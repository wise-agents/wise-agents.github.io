We welcome contributions from the community. This guide will walk you through the steps for getting started on our project. Forking the Project Issues Good First Issues Setting up your Developer Environment Contributing Guidelines Community Forking the Project To contribute, you will first need to fork the wise-agents repository. This can be done by looking in the top-right corner of the repository page and clicking \"Fork\". The next step is to clone your newly forked repository onto your local workspace. This can be done by going to your newly forked repository, which should be at https://github.com/USERNAME/wise-agents . Then, there will be a green button that says \"Code\". Click on that and copy the URL. Then, in your terminal, paste the following command: git clone [URL] Be sure to replace [URL] with the URL that you copied. Now you have the repository on your computer! Issues The wise-agents project uses GitHub to manage issues. All issues can be found here . To create a new issue, comment on an existing issue, or assign an issue to yourself, you'll need to first create a GitHub account . Good First Issues Want to contribute to the wise-agents project but aren't quite sure where to start? Check out our issues with the good-first-issue label. These are a triaged set of issues that are great for getting started on our project. These can be found here . Once you have selected an issue you'd like to work on, make sure it's not already assigned to someone else, and assign it to yourself. It is recommended that you use a separate branch for every issue you work on. To keep things straightforward and memorable, you can name each branch using the GitHub issue number. This way, you can have multiple PRs open for different issues. For example, if you were working on issue-125 , you could use issue-125 as your branch name. Setting up your Developer Environment You will need: Python 3.12+ Git An IDE (e.g., Microsoft Visual Studio Code ) To setup your development environment you need to: First cd to the directory where you cloned the project (eg: cd wise-agents ) Create a Python virtual environment for the project. The venv module supports creating lightweight \u201cvirtual environments\u201d, each with their own independent set of Python packages installed in their site directories. A virtual environment is created on top of an existing Python installation, known as the virtual environment\u2019s \u201cbase\u201d Python, and may optionally be isolated from the packages in the base environment, so only those explicitly installed in the virtual environment are available. For more information about virtual environment see here python -m venv .venv OR just using our Makefile make venv Activate the venv source .venv/bin/activate OR just using our Makefile make activate_venv Add a remote ref to upstream, for pulling future updates. For example: git remote add upstream https://github.com/wise-agents/wise-agents To build wise-agents run: make install To run the tests: start artemis: set .env for artemis see artemis/README.MD . Then start it using make artemis start graphdb: set .env for graphdb see graphdb/README.MD . Then start it using make graphdb start vectordb: set .env for vectordb see vectordb/README.MD . Then start it using make vectordb start LLM model serving: set .env for model-serving see model-serving/README.MD . Then start it using make model run the tests: make test To run only a specific test, use: If you want to run a single test you can specify the test with -k option: pytest -k test_register_agents --log-cli-level=DEBUG You can also run all tests contained in a single file with the same option pytest -k test_WiseAgentRegistry --log-cli-level=DEBUG Note the name of the file could be partial so for example pytest -k test_yaml --log-cli-level=DEBUG will run test contained in tests/wiseagents/test_yaml_deserializer.py and ``tests/wiseagents/test_yaml_serialization.py) Contributing Guidelines When submitting a PR, please keep the following guidelines in mind: In general, it's good practice to squash all of your commits into a single commit. For larger changes, it's ok to have multiple meaningful commits. If you need help with squashing your commits, feel free to ask us how to do this on your pull request. We're more than happy to help! Please link the issue you worked on in the description of your pull request and in your commit message. For example, for issue-125, the PR description and commit message could be: Go through TODOs in the code and create issues for them Fixes #125 Code Reviews All submissions, including submissions by project members, need to be reviewed by at least one wise-agents committer before being merged.

AI agents are autonomous software systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. They are designed to operate without human intervention (even if sometimes human input could be considered as part of the process), leveraging advanced AI techniques like natural language processing and machine learning. Key characteristics of AI agents Autonomy : AI agents can make decisions and act independently based on their goals and the information they gather. Flexibility : They can adapt to changing circumstances and learn from experience to improve their performance over time. Reactivity : AI agents can perceive their environment and respond to changes in real-time. Components of an AI Agent AI agents are composed of several key components that enable their autonomous behavior: * Sensors : Used to gather information from the environment, such as user inputs, sensor data, or external APIs. * Agent Function : The core decision-making algorithm that maps sensor inputs to actions. * Actuators : Mechanisms that allow the agent to affect its environment, such as generating text responses, making API calls, or sending notifications. * Goals : The objectives the agent is designed to achieve, which guide its decision-making process. What is a multi-agent AI framework? A multi-agent AI framework is a system where multiple intelligent agents interact or work together to perform complex tasks, solve problems, or simulate environments. These agents can be autonomous entities, each with its own capabilities, knowledge base, and goals. Here\u2019s a detailed description of a multi-agent AI framework: Key Components of a multi-agent AI framework Agents : Reactive Agents: Respond to changes in the environment. Deliberative Agents: Use reasoning and planning to achieve goals. Hybrid Agents: Combine reactive and deliberative strategies. Communication Mechanism : Direct Communication: Agents send messages to each other. Indirect Communication: Agents use shared context or memory. Coordination and Cooperation : Strategies for agents to work together towards common goals, avoid conflicts, and optimize joint performance. Examples: Task Allocation: Dividing tasks among agents based on their capabilities. Task planning and prioritization Negotiation/reasoning: Agents discuss to reach agreements. Conflict resolution: Avoid loops or infinite loops for the same question Challenge other agents: challenge previous steps to reduce hallucinations Decision-Making: Methods for agents to make choices based on their goals, perceptions, and available information. LLMs or other AI algorithms (tule engine, game theory etc) can be used. Retrieve additional informations : RAG agents can retrieve informations for better results. The agentic approach also permit a multi-step RAG refining progressively the information retrieved Advantages of multi-agent AI framework Scalability : Easily add more agents to the system to handle increased complexity or workload. Flexibility : Agents can be designed to specialize in different tasks, improving overall system performance. Robustness : Failure of one agent does not necessarily compromise the entire system, enhancing reliability. Efficiency : Distributed problem-solving can lead to faster and more efficient solutions. In summary, a multi-agent AI framework is a sophisticated and versatile system designed to handle complex, dynamic tasks by leveraging the collective intelligence and capabilities of multiple interacting agents. Applications of AI Agents AI agents have a wide range of applications across various industries: * Conversational AI: Chatbots and virtual assistants that can interact naturally. The interaction can be more complex and benefits of the multi-agent system characteristics described above. * Automation: Agents that can automate complex workflows and decision-making processes. * Problem-solving: Agents that can break down complex problems, generate solutions, and execute tasks.","title":"What are AI Agents"},{"location":"multi_agents/#what-are-ai-agents","text":"AI agents are autonomous software systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals.

What is RAG? Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) provides the ability to enhance the knowledge of a large language model (LLM) by incorporating additional information during response generation. This is very important because although LLMs are trained with extremely large quantities of data, this data is static, has a cut-off date, and likely lacks domain-specific information. RAG provides the ability to incorporate additional information obtained from knowledge sources to ground LLM responses using this information, resulting in better quality responses. How does RAG work? To be able to make use of RAG, the very first step is ingestion. Here, knowledge sources are processed, split into chunks of text, each chunk of text is converted to a vector representation (also known as an embedding), and then stored in a vector database. After this initial step, upon receiving a query, the goal is to retrieve the information that is most relevant to the query from the vector database. This is done by converting the query to a vector representation (i.e., embedding) and then querying the vector database to retrieve the chunks that are most similar to the query. The retrieved information is then included in a prompt to the LLM along with the original query. This helps the LLM to generate a response that is grounded in the retrieved information. Our architecture and implementations TODO What is Graph RAG? Graph RAG is a more structured approach to RAG. In standard RAG, as described above, the knowledge sources are simply split into chunks of text. However, there are many sources of information that actually have a lot of structure to them where this structure would be lost if just convert the knowledge source to text as is and split into chunks. For example, think about a bug report that has many different fields like \"Description\", \"Steps to Reproduce\", \"Relates To\", \"Resolution\", etc. If we just take the text from the bug report as is and just split the text into chunks, we'd lose all the structure that is inherently present in the bug report and the relationships to other bug reports. Graph RAG involves converting knowledge sources to knowledge graphs consisting of entities and relationships to preserve the structure that's inherent in the sources. How does Graph RAG work? Just like with standard RAG, the very first step is ingestion. Here, knowledge sources are processed and split into entities and relationships that are stored in a graph database. This can either be done manually or automatically using an LLM. After this initial step, upon receiving a query, the goal is to retrieve the information that is most relevant to the query from the graph database. This can be done by querying the graph database to extract relevant nodes and/or sub-graphs. As an example, let's consider the case where we have a graph database that consists of entities and relationships that have been derived from bug reports. If the query is \"NullPointerException when invoking method foo \", we can query the graph database to find bug reports with similar \"Descriptions\" and then extract additional relevant information from these bug reports like the \"Resolution\" for example. The retrieved information is then included in a prompt to the LLM along with the original query. This helps the LLM to generate a response that is grounded in the retrieved information. Graph RAG with Embedding-Based Retrieval In addition to simply querying the graph database, it's also possible to create a vector representation (embedding) for each entity in the graph and then use embedding-based retrieval as in standard RAG to retrieve sub-graphs from the graph database that are most similar to the query.

General Architecture WiseAgent is a multi-agent intelligent framework designed for distributed, asynchronous communication. It is capable of connecting to any LLM model or inference system that supports the OpenAI API, enabling the use of multiple different models within the same configuration. One of the key features of WiseAgent is its cloud readiness and distributed nature, allowing for the deployment of different components in separate pods, while also being able to run everything in a single process for simpler use cases. The following image provides a high-level overview of the architecture and flow: TODO Wise-Agent Components WiseAgents : These are the core components where the actual processing occurs. Each WiseAgent MUST be capable of communicating via the STOMP protocol. It MUST be able to process an input message in the WiseAgentMessage format and produce a WiseAgentMessage as output. An agent MAY have perceiving capabilities (such as monitoring changes in files, reacting to events, etc.). Additionally, it MAY integrate with an LLM through the OpenAI API, supporting tools (both external APIs and other agents acting as tools). A WiseAgent MAY be capable of taking actions, such as executing tools or APIs. The framework currently supports features like GraphRAG and tool calls, and it can be extended to support additional functionalities. Specialized implementations of WiseAgents can handle orchestration or triage of inputs. In essence, every component of the WiseAgent framework, except for the registry and context, is an agent with specific capabilities. WiseAgentMessage : This is the format used for communication between agents. There are generally two types of communication: The main content is carried in the WiseAgentMessage payload as natural language. The WiseAgentMessage is used solely for ACK/NACK purposes, with the actual content being part of the shared memory within a specific execution context. Communication Protocol : The WiseAgent framework is designed to enable asynchronous communication between agents. The current implementation uses the STOMP 1.0 protocol, which is supported by various message queue systems such as ArtemisMQ and RabbitMQ. LLM Integration : A WiseAgent MAY utilize an LLM to process requests and generate responses. This integration is facilitated through the standard OpenAI API, which supports any model or inference system that provides OpenAI API access. The framework manages the memory of previous message tokens that form the context for each LLM request, allowing these contexts to be shared between agents participating in the same execution context. Agents' Registry : When an agent is created and deployed, it registers itself with the Agents' Registry, providing a name and a detailed natural language description (with possible added metadata) of its capabilities. These descriptions are used by the coordinator to select the appropriate agents to solve a specific problem or to address a phase of the problem solution. Agents' Execution Context : Each session or query lifecycle is tracked within an execution context. This context stores shared information such as available and executed tools, the current phase of execution, etc. It also serves as the shared memory where agents collaborate to keep track of LLM interactions. By managing shared memory at the agents' level instead of the LLM integration level, the WiseAgent framework allows different agents\u2014potentially using different LLM models\u2014to share contextual information. Agents' Coordinator : The coordinator is responsible for organizing the work among agents. It determines which agents are needed to provide a solution, the order in which they should execute, and how they should cooperate to achieve the final result. The framework provides different coordinator implementations: SequentialCoordinator : Processes the request by routing it sequentially to various agents. Partial answers from each agent can be utilized by subsequent agents in the sequence, culminating in a final response to the client. PhasedCoordinatorWiseAgent : This coordinator groups agents into different phases and then executes each phase in parallel. The results from each agent enrich the shared context and can be selectively used by the coordinator or any other agent in subsequent phases. Agents within the same phase cannot depend on each other. Note: An agent defined to run in a specific phase can act as a SequentialCoordinator for complex compositions. Currently, it is not possible to compose another PhasedCoordinatorWiseAgent within a phase. Perceptions' Triage Agent : This is essentially another coordinator, specifically tasked with collecting, filtering, and aggregating inputs from agents with perceiving capabilities. The output from the triage process is a natural language question or problem description, complete with all relevant data and details. This output serves as the input for the Agents' Coordinator to produce a final answer or create an action plan. RAG Agents : Retrieving additional relevant information is a key capability of a multi-agent system. The WiseAgent framework provides advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and GraphRAG agents that can be used or extended. For more details, see RAG Architecture . LLM Integration As mentioned earlier, LLM integration is achieved through a client-side implementation of the OpenAI API. The responsibility for tracking messages exchanged with the LLM lies with the agent, not the LLM integration layer. This design choice makes the WiseAgent framework agnostic to the specific LLM model used, as long as the model and inference system support the OpenAI API. This approach allows different agents to potentially use different models while sharing a unified memory.
